# Apply DAST in Deployment Pipeline

## Objective:
The objective of this POC is to integrate **OWASP ZAP**, an open-source DAST tool, into a deployment pipeline. It allows you to automate the scanning of a web application to identify security vulnerabilities and generate actionable reports.

## How Does It Work?
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** tools work by analyzing a running application from the outside ‚Äî simulating how an attacker would interact with it ‚Äî to find security vulnerabilities in real-time.
- DAST is a form of **"Black-box" testing**. It tests an application without access to its source code by sending crafted HTTP requests and analyzing the responses.


## What Does It Help to Detect?

| Vulnerability Type         | Can DAST Detect?       |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **SQL Injection**          | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| **XSS (Reflected/Stored)** | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| **Open Redirects**         | ‚úÖ Yes                |
| **Security Headers Missing** | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| **Authentication Weaknesses** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited        |
| **CSRF**                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes          |
| **Business Logic Flaws**   | ‚ùå Usually not         |


## Steps to Integrate ZAP in deployment Pipeline

### 1. First Clone Juice-shop Github Repos on Local machine and run it

 - Go into the cloned folder with cd juice-shop
 - Run npm install
 - Run npm start
 - Browse to http://localhost:3000

### 2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow 

- Create a GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/` with the name `zap-dast.yml`.

### üìù What This Workflow Does

| Step                        | What It Does                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ **docker run Juice Shop** | Runs the vulnerable app locally in CI.                |
| üîç **ZAP Scan**             | Scans the app on `http://localhost:3000` using OWASP ZAP. |
| üìÑ **Uploads Report**       | Stores `zap_report.html` so you can download it from the Actions tab. |


### 2. Push the Changes and Check the DAST Report
